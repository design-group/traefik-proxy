<h1> <img src="https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/assets/img/traefikproxy-vertical-logo-color.svg" alt="Traefik Logo" height="80px" align="center" />  Local Proxy for Docker Containers </h1>

This repository provides a docker-compose stack that creates a Traefik Reverse Proxy and a Step-CA Certificate Authority. The Traefik Reverse Proxy is configured to use the Step-CA Certificate Authority to generate certificates for the `localtest.me` domain.

The Traefik Reverse Proxy is by default configured to connect over **HTTP**, but can easily be configured to use the certificates generated by the Step-CA Certificate Authority to provide TLS for a secure connection over **HTTPS**.

This allows you to easily add containers to the proxy and access them securely at:

`https://<desired-address>.localtest.me/`.

## Setup for HTTP Connection

1. Clone this repository locally.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/design-group/traefik-proxy.git traefik-proxy && cd traefik-proxy
    ```

2. Pull any changes to the docker image and start the container.
      
    On Mac:
    
	```sh
    docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
    ```
    
	On WSL
    
	```sh
    docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
    ```

## Setup for HTTPS Connection

1. Clone this repository locally.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/design-group/traefik-proxy.git traefik-proxy && cd traefik-proxy
    ```
2. Create the `certs` directory for the certificates generated by the Step-CA Certificate Authority.

	```sh
	mkdir certs
	```
3. To allow for the **HTTPS** redirect, go to the `docker-compose.yml` and uncomment line 19:

	```sh
 	TRAEFIK_ENTRYPOINTS_WEB_HTTP_MIDDLEWARES: redirect-to-https@file
  	```

4. Pull any changes to the docker image and start the container.
      
    On Mac:
    
	```sh
    docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
    ```
    
	On WSL
    
	```sh
    docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
    ```

5. Generate the certificates for the `localtest.me` domain
   
	```sh
	./generate-certs.sh
	```

6. Trust the root ca certificate generated by the script based on your OS.

## Usage

If you do not already have one in your project folder, create a file called `docker-compose.traefik.yml`.

In order to get your local environment to use this file, add the following to the `.env` file:

```sh
COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR=:
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.traefik.yml
```

To add an Ignition Gateway or other container to the proxy, add the following labels and environment variables to the `docker-compose.traefik.yml` file for each container in your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
labels:
  traefik.enable: "true"
  traefik.hostname: <desired-address>
environment:
  GATEWAY_PUBLIC_ADDRESS: <desired-address>
networks:
  - default
  - proxy
```

The traefik proxy is configured to use the `proxy` network, so we need to add the following networks to the project's `docker-compose.traefik.yml` file:

```yaml
networks:
  default:
  proxy:
    external: true
    name: proxy
```

For example, here is the pre-existing `docker-compose.yml` file for the basic [Ignition Gateway:](https://github.com/design-group/ignition-architecture-template)

```yaml
services:
  gateway:
    image: bwdesigngroup/ignition-docker:latest
    ports:
      - 8088
    volumes:
      - ./ignition-data:/workdir
      - ./backups/gateway.gwbk:/restore.gwbk
    environment:
      - SYMLINK_GITIGNORE=false
      - SYMLINK_LOGBACK=false
    command: >
      -r /restore.gwbk
```

and here is the `docker-compose.traefik.yml` file for the Ignition Gateway:

```yaml
services:
  gateway:
    labels:
      traefik.enable: "true"
      traefik.hostname: <desired-address>
    environment:
      GATEWAY_PUBLIC_ADDRESS: <desired-address>
    networks:
      - default
      - proxy

networks:
  default:
  proxy:
    external: true
    name: proxy
```

After adding the labels, environment variables, and replacing the `<desired-address>` fields, restart the container, or if the container was never running, type:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the container is running, it should be accessible at `http(s)://<desired-address>.localtest.me/`.

We dont necessarily _need_ to create the `docker-compose.traefik.yml` file to add the labels and environment variables. We could also add the labels and environment variables to the `docker-compose.yml` file directly. However, this would require that every developer working on this project has the same Traefik Reverse Proxy setup on their local machine. By using the `docker-compose.traefik.yml` file, we can keep the Traefik Reverse Proxy setup in this repository and not have to worry about every developer having the same setup.

## Enabling TLS for a secure connection over TCP

If you want to enable TLS for a secure connection over TCP, add the following labels to the project's `docker-compose.traefik.yml` container:

```yaml
traefik.tcp.routers.<router-name>.tls: "true"
traefik.tcp.routers.<router-name>.rule: "HostSNI(`<desired-address>.localtest.me`)"
traefik.tcp.routers.<router-name>.service: "<router-name>"
traefik.tcp.services.<router-name>.loadbalancer.server.port: "<port>"
```

For example, to enable TLS for a secure connection over TCP for a Neo4J Graph Database, add the following labels to the project's `docker-compose.traefik.yml` container:

```yaml
traefik.tcp.routers.neo4j.tls: "true"
traefik.tcp.routers.neo4j.rule: "HostSNI(`neo4j.localtest.me`)"
traefik.tcp.routers.neo4j.service: "neo4j"
traefik.tcp.services.neo4j.loadbalancer.server.port: "7687"
```
